Chapter 1: Introduction

	Have you ever desired to be a member of an order ancient assassins destined to fight an ancient order of zealots until the end of time, maybe desired to be a powerful warrior, destined to fell even the strongest of foes to come to your doorstep, man and elder God alike?

…Well this program will not provide that to you, but what it does provide is a greater sense of belonging and purpose for the end user, allowing them to define goals for them to strive towards and fulfill in a fun and interactive environment.

Chapter 2: How Real Stats operates.
	
	The Real Stats program is a fun mixture of a Life Tracker and an RPG, giving the user a fun, game-like experience while letting them see active progress towards their real-life goals. It does this by tracking challenges, either defined by the user or by the program itself, and giving them XP (Experience points) based on the complexity and length of the task.



Chapter 3: Step 1, Account Creation

	On startup, the program will give a prompt, as seen below.
The user can either click New game to create a new profile, with a new character and fresh new character sheet, or they can click Load game, which will prompt them to insert a save file to restore their character. If you are a returning user, skip to step 3.

Chapter 4: Step 2, Character Creation
The user can now go on to either select a predefined character or establish their own, listing their career, family, character name, and goals they strive for.

Chapter 5: Step 3, Gameplay
There are 8 categories each character is defined by, these attributes are:
⦁	Mood – How you feel in your daily life.
⦁	Fitness – Workout goals and personal health.
⦁	Career – How you feel about your personal career life.
⦁	Friends – Your social life.
⦁	Companionship – Your life with your partner.
⦁	Spirituality – Your link to your spiritual beliefs.
⦁	School – Your Scholarly goals.
⦁	Family – Your family life.
As users complete goals in each of these categories their stats will slowly rise, rewarding you with a fun popup fanfare with a musical queue for each and every “Quest” accomplished by the user. This is meant to not only grant a sense of accomplishment on leveling up but to give a bit of gratitude to the user with every single task logged via the usage of the app. 

Chapter 6: Step 4, Have fun!
If the end user does not have fun with our program, we have failed in our duty as a company. Unfortunately, we are unable to accept refunds at this time, as we aren’t actually a company, but are just a group of college students taking high level programming classes. There is no money. So, please just have fun in the first place.
